# Custom keycap templates for Q1 / GMMK keyboards, based on modern Macs

This is an SVG template file for use with custom keycap manufacturers, based on current / modern Mac keyboards. I edited this with Inkscape. 

Currently just have one for WASD's custom keycaps on the Q1 / GMMK layout, but I'll probably be making one for MAX Keyboards shinethrough keys in a similar fashion.

There are two layers, one with editable text, one with it converted to stroke. If you want to make edits make sure you get the Apple San Francisco and San Francisco Compact fonts from here: https://developer.apple.com/fonts/. The text is in white to be printed on black keycaps, you may need to change that if you're changing keycap color.

I really fussed over these to try to get it as close to what Apple would do today as possible. 

Some details I'm proud of:
- Use of San Francisco Compact instead of VAG Modern to match current laptops & Magic Keyboards
- All of the glyphs (except above F3 and F4, which I created by hand) come from symbols embedded in the font.
- The Q1 has fewer keys than the GMMK, so I used the extras to provide alternatives for the F4-F6 keys (if you want it to exactly match a 2021 Macbook Pro.)
- The " ' key uses the close / right hand single and double quotes instead of the straight ones.
- The ^ above the 6 is actually the same glyph that the control key uses, not a standard ^. 
- I used the forward-delete glyph from the current Magic Keyboard with numpad.
- Alignment of the modifier keys was based off the previous space grey Magic Keyboard w/numpad. The keys on the outer edges are aligned against the outer edges, and the rest align against the inside edge. (Versus having the control keys aligned against the inside edge as they are on the current Magic Keyboard - I figure Apple moved that because of the larger curve in the outer keys, which we don't have here.) 
- The fn / globe key was something I made my own call on. I personally use the input / language switching so I kept the globe icon, but flipped it around to make more sense with the keys around it. (That said, the fn key on a stock Q1 doesn't work like a "real" fn key on an Apple keyboard so I don't have the language switching working yet. Hopefully soon!) 

It's probably not exactly perfect, but it's really close, and I think it's all within the general design language of previous keyboards from Apple. Go ahead and make whatever changes you'd like before sending it along for production.
